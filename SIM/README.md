### Tetraploid potato data
Data subset from potato genotypes originally described in Enciso-Rodriguez et al. (2017, https://doi.org/10.1534/g3.118.200273) and parsed in Zingaretti et al. 2018, pSBVB: A Versatile Simulation Tool To Evaluate Genomic Selection in Polyploid Species (http://www.g3journal.org/content/9/2/327).

Jupyter notebook and potato.py script illustrates use of 'gen' format for genotypes, polyploidy usage, and generation of an F2 cross.
