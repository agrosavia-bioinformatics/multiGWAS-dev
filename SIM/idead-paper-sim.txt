- For real-experiment data, power analysis usually relies on many
factors, including knowledge of Linkage Disequilibrium (LD), which SNPs have been
genotyped and selected within the LD for GWAS (called tagged SNPs), and a good
representative sample. Since it is hard to control each of these factors precisely (e.g. a
perfect representative sample), results from a power calculation may be difficult to obtain
and may not reflect what would actually happen in real experiments. Therefore, it is
worthwhile to take a practical approach to examine how input data quantity (sample size)
influences GWAS results in real experiments.
